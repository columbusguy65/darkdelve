To the west, at the foot of the trail, waves crash violently into a cluster of craggy black boulders that extend far out into the ocean from the cliff.  To the North, you see the mouth of an enormous cave. </desc>

There are a few small tide pools closer to the cliff, and there seems to be motion within them.  In the face of the cliff itself, there is an indentation where the rock appears smoother and more regular.</desc>

The concave stone walls are slimy and eroded, but a sandy floor allows you to keep your footing.  The air reeks of rotting fish.  The cave quickly narrows as it progresses further inside, until it's about eight cubits high.  The floorwhen exposed is slick weathered stone.  Thirty paces along the way into the deepening gloom, a series of very wide steps leads downwards into the darkness on your left.  To your right, a square opening braced by rough timbers leads to a horizontal shaft.  The cave also continues northward, curving away to the right. </desc>

The stone has been weathered smooth as if by millenia of frequent use.  The passage forms a descending rounded shaft with no true walls or ceiling, but the series of steps within are squared and even.  100 long steps down from the cave entrance, there is an intersection. </desc>

Clusters of stalactites and stalagmites obscure your view, but the area is filled with the detritus of some activity in the distant past.  There are rotting remains of extensive wooden scaffoldings in several places, piles of rubble from smashed rocks, and signs of digging.  There are rags, waste, and rusted tools on the floor, some strewn about and some in jumbled heaps.  You see at least three human skeletons. Two are in the northeast corner of the chamber, and one is laid across an iron grate to the South.  </desc>

At the edges of the chamber, The Grand stairway continues ever downwards to the West, but there is another, wider but more eroded series of descending steps to the South. To the North is an ornate archway which leads to an obviously manmade corridor. </desc>
